# clipclean-lite

A silent clipboard cleaner for macOS.

## Why

macOS often adds invisible formatting, control characters, or strange symbols when you copy text.  
This tool strips everything â€” instantly and silently.

## Features

- Removes invisible formatting and control characters
- Converts smart quotes to straight quotes
- Runs silently, no output, no options

## Install

```bash
